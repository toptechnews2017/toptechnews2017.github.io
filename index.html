              This week brought more and more gadget deals as Labor Day weekend inched closer. Many of this week's deals are still available right now, including Amazon's discount on the first- and second-generation Echo Show 5 smart displays and a $20 discount on Google's Nest Audio speaker. Plus, a bunch of new sales are running now through the holiday, including those on Dyson vacuums, OLED smart TVs, wireless earbuds and more. Here are the best Labor Day tech sales we could find.MacBook Air M1Apple's MacBook Air M1 is back down to an all-time low of $850 thanks to an automatically applied coupon. It earned a score of 94 from us for its stellar performance, attractive, fanless design and its comfortable keyboard and trackpad.Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $850Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red EditionThe 40mm Series 6 Product Red Edition is down to $249, which is a record low. When the Apple Watch falls to this low of a price, it tends to go in and out of stock often (especially on Amazon), so we recommend grabbing it quickly if you're set on buying one. While the next-gen Apple Watch could debut this month, the Series 6 is the best model you can get right now and we gave it a score of 89 for its solid performance, improved battery life and useful hand-washing timer feature.Buy Series 6 (Product Red) at Amazon - $249Buy Series 6 (Product Red) at Best Buy - $249AirPods ProApple's AirPods Pro are down to $190 right now, or $60 off their normal price.

This is a good machine to get if you have an older desktop that needs replacing, but you don't want to spend a ton of money.Buy Mac Mini M1 at Amazon - $600Echo Show 5Both the first- and second-generation Echo Show 5s are on sale right now — the original is down to $45 while the updated version is only $10 more. These stand out as excellent smart alarm clocks thanks to their compact size, sunrise alarm feature and tap-to-snooze function. The main difference between the two is the improved, 2MP camera on the second-gen version, which will make for slightly better video calls.Buy Echo Show 5 (1st gen) at Amazon - $45Buy Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) at Amazon - $55Google Nest AudioGoogle's Nest Audio smart speaker remains on sale for $80, or $20 off its normal price.

We believe the launch of the Pixel 6 to be right around the corner, so you may want to wait if you want the latest phone from Google. However, the Pixel 4 remains a solid handset — we liked its speedy performance, lovely display and stellar camera experience.Buy Pixel 4 at B&H - $379Samsung T7 Touch SSD (1TB)Samsung's T7 Touch portable SSD in 1TB is down to $170, or $10 off its normal price.
