              Best Buy is back with a new three-day sale that reduces the prices of many gadgets, including laptops and tablets from Microsoft and Samsung. Through August 15, you can grab the Surface Pro 7 with its Type Cover for as low as $599 and a Core i5 model of the Surface Laptop Go for $750. Samsung's flagship tablets, the Tab S7 and S7+, are both on sale, while the already affordable Tab S6 Lite is even cheaper at $270. Here are the best tech deals we found in Best Buy's latest weekend sale.Google WiFi (3 pack)Google's mesh WiFi kit with one router and two access points is $50 off, bringing it down to $150 (Amazon's matching the deal as well). This system came out at the end of last year and it supports speeds up to 1.2Gpbs. Each node covers up to 1,500 square feet, so you're getting a ton of coverage with this three-pack. While it's not as fast as the Nest WiFi system, it's a good upgrade for those who may still be relying on a router from their ISP.Buy Google WiFi (3 pack) at Best Buy - $150Buy Google WiFi (3 pack) at Amazon - $150Galaxy Chromebook 2The Galaxy Chromebook 2 is down to $449 for the Intel Celeron model with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Core i3 model will set you back $599, but that's still a decent deal. We gave this laptop a score of 82 for its impressive screen, loud speakers and solid performance.Buy Galaxy Chromebook 2 at Best Buy - $449Surface Pro 7 bundleThe base Surface Pro 7 with its Type Cover is down to $599 for this sale, or $360 off its normal price. This model has a Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage — we'd be wary about using a device with 4GB of RAM as your primary device (unless it's a Chromebook), but this would make a good convertible for those that want a lighter device to tote around with them.Buy Surface Pro 7 bundle at Best Buy - $59955-inch LG A1 OLED 4K TVThe latest LG OLED lineup just became available a few months ago and now you can grab the 55-inch A1 model for $1,300.

This is a good price for the upgraded model with more RAM, as most people will need at least 8GB on their daily driver. We gave the Laptop Go a score of 81 for its solid, minimalist design, excellent keyboard and trackpad and speedy performance.Buy Surface Laptop Go at Best Buy - $750Galaxy Tab S7Best Buy and Amazon have knocked $120 off Samsung's Galaxy Tab S7, bringing the total price to $530. The S7+ is also on sale for $730.

That gets you a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage — more than enough power for most Chrome OS users. We gave the Go a score of 84 for its thin-and-light design, good performance and solid battery life.Buy Pixelbook Go at Best Buy - $750Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.
