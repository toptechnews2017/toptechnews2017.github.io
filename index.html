Apple's 10.2-inch iPad is $30 off right now and Solo Stove, the maker of compact, stainless steel fire pits, has knocked $120 off most of its devices. We even have a few holdouts from Amazon Prime Day still available, like deals on Anker's Eufy RoboVac 11S and a two-pack Nest WiFi system. Here are the best July 4th tech deals we could find.10.2-inch iPadThe 10.2-inch iPad remains on sale for $299, or $30 off its normal price.

Plus, you never have to remember to turn it off because the pen automatically turns on when you pick it up and will shut off after some time of no use.ThermoWorks is also running an Independence Day sale that knocks up to 20 percent off remote BBQ alarm thermometers.Buy Thermapen Mk4 at ThermoWorks - $69Shop ThermoWorks Independence Day saleApple Watch Series 6 Product Red EditionThe GPS + Cellular models of the Apple Watch Series 6 Product Red Edition are $100 off at Amazon.
