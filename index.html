              The iOS 15 release brings an added treat if you're a fan of immersive audio: a better soundstage for your tunes. As hinted at WWDC in June, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 users now have dynamic head tracking for spatial audio in Apple Music. So long as you're using the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, instruments and vocals will have a fixed-in-place virtual presence — turn your head and that guitar or vocal will pan accordingly.Apple had promised Apple Music head tracking in the fall, but hadn't directly linked it to iOS 15 at the time. You don't need Apple's higher-end AirPods if you're content with 'regular' spatial audio, although you will need some form of AirPods or Beats earphones if you want automatic Dolby Atmos support.Yes, it's a not-so-subtle sales pitch for higher-end AirPods. It's only useful for that subset of the Apple Music catalog with spatial audio support, for that matter. All the same, it could be appreciated if you want a more natural-sounding (or at least, less jarring) approach to 360-degree audio.

                  Activision Blizzard says it's cooperating with investigations into workplace practices

              Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick says the company is working with regulators who are looking into its workplace practices, despite allegations it attempted to stymie investigations. “While we continue to work in good faith with regulators to address and resolve past workplace issues, we also continue to move ahead with our own initiatives to ensure that we are the very best place to work," Kotick said in a press release. "We remain committed to addressing all workplace issues in a forthright and prompt manner.”Kotick claimed that the company is "deeply committed to making Activision Blizzard one of the best, most inclusive places to work anywhere." He said there's no room for "discrimination, harassment or unequal treatment," while touting Activision Blizzard's "extraordinary track record of delivering superior shareholder returns for over 30 years."The CEO noted that Activision Blizzard is working with regulators including the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). It's also cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation.The DFEH filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in July. It claimed there was widespread harassment and discrimination at the company and that it had a sexist "frat boy" culture. In an updated filing in August, the DFEH accused the company of interfering with its investigation, claiming that human resources personnel shredded "documents related to investigations and complaints."Activision Blizzard workers filed a complaint with the NLRB last week. They accused the company of violating labor law by allegedly intimidating staff out of discussing forced arbitration, which is used to manage disputes. On Monday, the SEC confirmed it's investigating Activision Blizzard's workplace practices — Kotick is among those who the agency has subpoenaed.Meanwhile, Blizzard's chief legal officer Claire Hart has departed the company. In a LinkedIn post spotted by Game Developer, Hart said she left on Friday after holding the post for over three years. Her departure came just days before the SEC said it's looking into Blizzard's parent company.

Tuesday’s sanctions will block all trades involving the cryptocurrency exchange Suex and US entities.
