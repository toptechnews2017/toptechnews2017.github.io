              If you're anything like us, you probably pay for quite a few subscription services each month. Everything from music and TV streaming to guided meditations to password management has a service that you can pay for to make your life more convenient. These are also things we don't think about buying very often — typically, you sign up once and only revisit the service when you're thinking of changing things up or cancelling. But Black Friday is a good opportunity to check out new subscription services you may have considered in the past because many of them have sales for new (and sometimes returning) customers. Here are the best deals on subscription services you can get this Black Friday.Adobe CC All Apps planFirst-time subscribers to Adobe CC can get the All Apps plan for 40 percent off right now, bringing the monthly charge down to $30. If you're a student, it's even cheaper — just $16 per month for first-time customers. These programs are considered standard in most creative fields, so it's worth grabbing this deal if you know you'll be using things like Photoshop or Illustrator in the future.Subscribe to All Apps plan at Adobe - $30/monthHeadspaceThe meditation app Headspace is down to $5 per month for new and returning customers for Black Friday. That's 60 percent off the normal price, and those who want to pay for a year upfront will get 50 percent off and pay only $35 for the year. Headspace has a bunch of guided meditation sessions along with sleep stories, calming ambient music, guided yoga sessions for stress management and more.Subscribe to Headspace starting at $5/monthHulu (ad-supported)Hulu's Black Friday deal knocks the price of its ad-supported plan down to only $1 per month. That's $6 off its normal price, and those who sign up will get that discount for a full year. While the offer is available to both new and returning subscribers, you cannot claim the deal if you've been a Hulu subscriber within the past month.Subscribe to Hulu (ad-supported) - $1/monthAudibleNew subscribers can join Audible right now for 60 percent off, or $6 per month, for the first three months and you'll get a $20 Audible credit along with it. After three months, the subscription price will go back up to the standard $15-per-month rate. Audible Premium Plus gives you access to hundreds of audiobooks, plus one credit per month to use on any title of your choosing. It also gives you access to members-only sales, which often knock titles down to as low as $5 each.Subscribe to Audible - $6/monthLibro.fmLibro.fm is an audiobook platform that helps you support local bookstores with your purchases and you can get an extra free book credit when you sign up with the code CHOOSEINDIE. That's on top of the standard one credit you get with your first month of membership, so you're getting a total of two credits to use immediately. Libro.fm's prices are in line with Audible's as well — $15 per month for a standard subscription.Subscribe to Libro.fm - $15/monthAffinity creative programsSerif's Adobe CC competitors, the Affinity suite of creative apps, are 30 percent off for Black Friday. That includes Affinity Photo, Designer and Publisher programs for all platforms as well as the rest of the company's workbooks and other content. These apps are great options if you're looking for alternatives to things like Photoshop that don't require recurring subscription fees.Shop Affinity programsTidal HiFiFor those curious about Tidal's HiFi service, you can take advantage of the company's Black Friday sale and get three months of the music service for just $1.

              India is looking to bar most private cryptocurrencies when it introduces a new bill to regulate virtual currencies in the winter session of Parliament, the government said late on Tuesday.

              Shares of Zoom Video Communications Inc slumped to 17-month lows on Tuesday after the video conferencing platform posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth amid stiff competition from deep-pocketed rivals Cisco, Microsoft and Salesforce.
