              As July comes to a close, a number of laptops, earbuds, games and more have gone on sale across the web. Students planning their back-to-school shopping list have a few ways to save on Apple products — the latest MacBook Air M1 is $150 off at Amazon (that's better than Apple's own education discount) and the iPad Air remains $100 off as well. All capacities of Samsung's T7 portable SSD have been discounted, so you can grab one for as low as $70, while Microsoft's Xbox Ultimate Game Sale knocks up to 80 percent off console and PC titles. Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today.MacBook Air M1The latest MacBook Air M1 is down to $850 at Amazon, or $150 off its regular price. The 512GB model has the same discount, so you can grab it for $1,099. It's one of the best laptops for most people, and it's a great option for students going back to school. The Air M1 earned a score of 94 from us for its incredibly fast performance, excellent keyboard and trackpad, good battery life and lack of fan noise.Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,099iPad AirThe latest iPad Air is down to the best price we've seen it, just $500 for the base model. That's $100 off its normal price and a great deal on what we think is the best iPad for most people. We gave the slab a score of 90 for its fast performance, speedy WiFi, healthy battery life and support for the second-generation Apple Pencil.Buy iPad Air (64GB) at Amazon - $500Buy iPad Air (256GB) at Amazon - $639Buy iPad Air (64GB, cellular) at Amazon - $629Buy iPad Air (256GB, cellular) at Amazon - $780AirPods ProThe AirPods Pro are back on sale for $190, or $60 off their normal price. While not a record low, it's still one of the best prices we've seen all year. The AirPods Pro earned a score of 87 for their improved audio quality, comfortable fit, solid ANC and IPX4 water resistance.Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $19010.2-inch iPadApple's 10.2-inch iPad is still on sale for $299, or $30 off its normal price. It's arguably the best iPad for new tablet owners and we liked its improved performance, familiar design and support for the first-generation Apple Pencil.Buy 10.2-inch iPad at Amazon - $299Mario Kart Live: Home CircuitNintendo's Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit game for the Switch is down to $75, or $25 off its normal price.

We gave these a score of 80 for their improved sound quality, good ANC and smaller, comfortable design.Buy Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80Buy Echo Buds (wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100Echo Show 5 (1st-gen)Amazon's first-generation Echo Show 5 returned to its all-time-low price of $45 at Best Buy. If you're looking for a smart alarm clock of sorts, this is the best option if you already use Alexa as your primary voice assistant. The second-generation Echo Show 5, which came out recently, has a few minor differences, but we think the first-generation remains a solid buy — especially at half off its original price.Buy Echo Show 5 (1st-gen) at Best Buy - $45Xbox Ultimate Game SaleMicrosoft's Xbox Ultimate Game Sale is still ongoing, knocking up to 80 percent off console and PC titles.
