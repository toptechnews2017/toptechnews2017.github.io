              If you're anything like us, you probably pay for quite a few subscription services each month. Everything from music and TV streaming to guided meditations to password management has a service that you can pay for to make your life more convenient. These are also things we don't think about buying very often — typically, you sign up once and only revisit the service when you're thinking of changing things up or cancelling. But Black Friday is a good opportunity to check out new subscription services you may have considered in the past because many of them have sales for new (and sometimes returning) customers. Here are the best deals on subscription services you can get this Black Friday.Adobe CC All Apps planFirst-time subscribers to Adobe CC can get the All Apps plan for 40 percent off right now, bringing the monthly charge down to $30. If you're a student, it's even cheaper — just $16 per month for first-time customers. These programs are considered standard in most creative fields, so it's worth grabbing this deal if you know you'll be using things like Photoshop or Illustrator in the future.Subscribe to All Apps plan at Adobe - $30/monthHeadspaceThe meditation app Headspace is down to $5 per month for new and returning customers for Black Friday. That's 60 percent off the normal price, and those who want to pay for a year upfront will get 50 percent off and pay only $35 for the year. Headspace has a bunch of guided meditation sessions along with sleep stories, calming ambient music, guided yoga sessions for stress management and more.Subscribe to Headspace starting at $5/monthHulu (ad-supported)Hulu's Black Friday deal knocks the price of its ad-supported plan down to only $1 per month. That's $6 off its normal price, and those who sign up will get that discount for a full year. While the offer is available to both new and returning subscribers, you cannot claim the deal if you've been a Hulu subscriber within the past month.Subscribe to Hulu (ad-supported) - $1/monthAudibleNew subscribers can join Audible right now for 60 percent off, or $6 per month, for the first three months and you'll get a $20 Audible credit along with it.

Libro.fm's prices are in line with Audible's as well — $15 per month for a standard subscription.Subscribe to Libro.fm - $15/monthAffinity creative programsSerif's Adobe CC competitors, the Affinity suite of creative apps, are 30 percent off for Black Friday.
